# MA_coll_radicals
Code from my internship in the Molecular Biomechanics (MBM) group at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies on developing machine learning models for hydrogen atom transfer reaction barrier prediction in collagen.

* 'barrier_prediction.ipynb': Notebook to prepare the data for and train the final machine learning model.
* 'readout': Scripts to read out Gaussian calculations and compute descriptors.
